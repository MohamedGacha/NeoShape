* swing implementation example of union intersection etc:
        public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)g;
        ...
        Area areaOne = new Area(ellipse);
        Area areaTwo = new Area(rectangle);
        if (option.equals("add")) areaOne.add(areaTwo);
        else if (option.equals("intersection")) areaOne.intersect(areaTwo);
        else if (option.equals("subtract")) areaOne.subtract(areaTwo);
        else if (option.equals("exclusive or")) areaOne.exclusiveOr(areaTwo);
        g2.setPaint(Color.orange);
        g2.fill(areaOne);
        g2.setPaint(Color.black);
        g2.draw(areaOne);
        }


* shapes subclasses:
    - awt.Polygon [awt] (defined by list of points):
    - rectangle [awt]:
            - square
    - ellipse [geom.Ellipse2D.Double/Float]: (choose double or float will depending on the canvas' precision )
        - circle (width = height)
    - arc [geom.arc2d]
    - polyline ( DONT make it mother of polygon cuz polygon is not only a polyline which endpoint=startpoint but should also check if lines intersect with each other, math stufff)
        - triangle (choose method of creation of ur choice/ use multiple creation methods)

* each sub-shape needs to have:
    - constructor
    - draw
    - select (tricky for some)
    - unselect
    - getLayer for advanced selection
    -? fill
    -? getcenter/getpoints/...


* set buffering strategy and other settings for jframe

* will not use a shape mother class, because if i do i wont be able to make the class Ellipse a child of both Shape and awt.Ellipse2d, i will have to add a middleclass between them and i'd rather use interface and keep the uml class structure as small as possible
* also shape is already defined in awt as an interface, so all the predefined classes that will be used already have it
* canvastools contains the needed functions for canvas operations (select,fill,draaw...)
